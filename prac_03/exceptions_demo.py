1. When will a ValueError occur?
2. When will a ZeroDivisionError occur?
3. Could you change the code to avoid the possibility of a ZeroDivisionError?

# 1. The ValueError could happen when the input is not defined as integer.

# 2. The ZeroDivisionError could occur if the second output or the division is zero.

# Could you change the code to avoid the possibility of a ZeroDivisionError?
