## SELF EVALUATION 

## 3 main lessons you have learned about "clean code" in this subject

- first of all, clean code make us better understand the proposal of each code usage (function, variable, method)
- Properly structuring code using functions, classes, and modules enhances maintainability. Break down complex tasks into smaller, reusable components for a cleaner and more manageable codebase.
- Documenting code with clear comments and docstrings is essential for communication. It not only helps others understand your code but also aids in debugging and maintenance.
